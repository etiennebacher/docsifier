Description: Sometimes, developers want to create a specific webpage for 
    their documentation, so that they can easily describe in details how to use their
    package for instance. A very popular package to easily generate such a page is 
    'pkgdown'. But there exists many tools to create static pages from
    Markdown documents. One example is 'docsify.js'. The role of 'docsifier'
    is to provide helpers for using 'docsify.js', such as importation of 
    key files for the documentation, creation of new files, and live preview
    of the webpage.
