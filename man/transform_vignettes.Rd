transform_vignettes()
}
\description{
Vignettes files (originally placed in the folder "Vignettes") have the output "html_vignette", which doesn't allow to produce the Markdown files needed for docsifier to work. This function makes several things:
\itemize{
\item moves the .Rmd files from the "vignettes" folder in "docs/articles"
\item replaces the "output chunk" of each .Rmd file (in "docs/articles") so that it is "md_document" instead of "html_vignette"
\item render all of the modified .Rmd files (in "docs/articles"), which produce .md files.
}
