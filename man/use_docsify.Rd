\description{
Create the structure to use docsify in an R package
}
\details{
This function creates the folder "/docs" (if it doesn't already exist) and "index.html" to create the documentation with docsify.js. The structure of "index.html" is automatically created and you can complete it with your custom info.
You can use \code{add_md()} to add Markdown files in "/docs" to populate the documentation.

You can add a page containing the list of functions that your package provide, and their documentation. Internal functions (i.e functions that are not exported by the package) are included by default. If you don't want to include them, add "@keywords internal" in the roxygen block of the function concerned, and use \code{include_internal = FALSE}.
