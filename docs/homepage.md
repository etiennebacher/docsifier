# Welcome!

This is the homepage of the package [`{docsifier}`](https://github.com/etiennebacher/docsifier).

## Purpose of this package

Developers may want to build a webpage that contains the documentation of their package or project. [`{pkgdown}`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/index.html) is the most famous way to easily build such a page for an R package.

The aim of `{docsifier}` is to provide an alternative to developers by bringing [`docsify.js`](https://docsify.js.org/#/) into R. `docsify.js` is a tool that uses Markdown files to create a static webpage very easily. 


## Installation

For now, this package is only available on GitHub. You can install it with: 

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("etiennebacher/docsifier")
```
