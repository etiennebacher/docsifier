# Welcome!

This is the homepage of the package [`{docsifier}`](https://github.com/etiennebacher/docsifier).

## Purpose of this package

Package developers may want to build a webpage that contains the documentation of their package. [`{pkgdown}`](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/articles/pkgdown.html) is the most famous way to easily build such a page.

The aim of this package is to propose a new alternative to package developers by bringing [`docsify.js`](https://docsify.js.org/#/) into R. `docsify.js` is a tool that uses Markdown files to create a static webpage very easily. 

**Note that at this stage of development, you can only use `{docsifier}` inside a package environment.**


## Installation

For now, this package is only available on GitHub. You can install it with:
