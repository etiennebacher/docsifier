## Customize with CSS

There are [many themes](https://docsify.js.org/#/themes) available for `docsify.js`, but you might want to add a custom CSS. You can use `add_css()` to create CSS file in `docs/_assets/css`, and then you can manually add it in `index.html`.

## Options and plugins

Like themes, `docsify.js` puts a lot of options at your disposal. There are also many plugins developed to enhance your documentation. Since these options and plugins are already well presented in the official documentation, I will not present them here but rather encourage you to check them:

* [See options](https://docsify.js.org/#/configuration)

* [See plugins](https://docsify.js.org/#/plugins)
